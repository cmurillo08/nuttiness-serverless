# Responsive Tailwind UI

- Treat responsive behavior as part of the initial implementation, not a later cleanup pass.
- Build mobile-first with unprefixed Tailwind classes first, then add `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:` only for necessary enhancements.
- Optimize primarily for phone widths from 320px to 430px and laptop widths from 1024px to 1440px.
- Use `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`, `py-4 sm:py-6`, `w-full`, and `min-w-0` as the default foundation for flexible page layouts.
- Default grids and content sections to one column on small screens and only increase columns at larger breakpoints when readability remains strong.
- Default flex layouts to `flex-col`; only switch to horizontal layouts at larger breakpoints when actions and content still scan cleanly.
- Prefer wrapped or stacked action rows, filters, and metadata groups on mobile instead of forcing everything onto one line.
- For forms, use one-column layouts by default, move to two columns only when the fields are short or the larger breakpoint clearly improves usability, and keep controls touch-friendly.
- For dense tables and reports, reduce columns first; if the data still does not fit, prefer mobile cards or list rows before relying on horizontal scrolling.
- Use `overflow-x-auto` only when the structure is truly tabular and cannot be meaningfully restructured for mobile.
- Treat sidebar and shell behavior as a root responsive concern: on phones, prefer an overlay drawer or other dismissible navigation instead of a persistent narrow rail.
- If a page feels cramped, check whether the shell is the constraint before shrinking text, spacing, or controls.
- Avoid hard-coded widths, large fixed paddings, and layout choices that only work because desktop has extra horizontal space.
- Preserve the existing visual language of the repo while making the layout intentionally usable on both mobile and laptop.
- Before finishing, verify there is no unintended horizontal scrolling, primary actions remain easy to reach on phones, and the main content stays readable on laptops.
